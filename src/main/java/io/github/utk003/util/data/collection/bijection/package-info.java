/**
 * A package for the custom collection {@link io.github.utk003.util.data.collection.bijection.Bijection}.
 * <p>
 * {@code Bijection}s, as per their mathematical definition, create unique mappings between pairs of objects.
 * Such mappings are 1:1. In other words, any object is mapped to exactly 1 other object, and that other object
 * is mapped to the first. For more on bijections, check out
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection" target="_top">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection</a>.
